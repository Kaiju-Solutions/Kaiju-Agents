# Agents

There are four types of agents each derived from the [`KaijuAgent` class](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuAgent.html "KaijuAgent"), with the different types defining what drives the [movement](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/movement.html "Movement") of the agent:

1. [Transform](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuTransformAgent.html "Transform Agent") - Moves directly with the [transform](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-transform.html "Transform"). This agent does not collide with object or cause any collision or trigger events to be fired.
2. [Rigidbody](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuRigidbodyAgent.html "Rigidbody Agent") - Moves respecting physics using a [rigidbody component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/rigidbody-physics-section.html "Rigidbody"), allowing for the collisions and their related events to be activated by this agent.
    - **If you are unsure of which agent type to use for your use case, it is recommeneded you choose this type to start.**
3. [Character](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuCharacterAgent.html) - Moves with a [character controller component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/character-control-section.html "Character Controller"). In general, this behaves about the same as the [rigidbody agent](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuRigidbodyAgent.html "Rigidbody Agent").
4. [Navigation](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuNavigationAgent.html) - Moves by a [navigation mesh agent component](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/AI.NavMeshAgent.html), and like the [transform agent](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuTransformAgent.html "Transform Agent"), does not fire collision or trigger events.
    - **Note that _all four_ agent types can fully perform navigation and pathfinding, not just the [navigation agent](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuNavigationAgent.html)**

Agents must be added to root-level [GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html "GameObject"), and cannot be nested under other [GameObjects](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html "GameObject"). One agent is allowed per [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html "GameObject").

## Movement

Each agent can set their speed and acceleration for performing [movements](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/movement.html) in addition to the look speed. This can be done via the [inspector](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UsingTheInspector.html "Inspector Window") or via the [`KaijuAgent` API](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuAgent.html "KaijuAgent").

Additionally, the [`KaijuAgent` API](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuAgent.html "KaijuAgent") provides methods exposing how perform all the [movements](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/movement.html). These [movement](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/movement.html) methods can have their parameters explicitly passed to them. If not passed, all parameters will default to that of the [movement configuration](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/movement.html#configuration) assigned to the agent. If no [movement configuration](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/movement.html#configuration) is assigned, the values will fallback to the default values outlined in the constant defined in each [movement](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/movement.html) class.

## Controlling Agents

There is a lot of flexibility as to how you can add intelligent behaviour to agents! The most common method is creating a class which extends from [`MonoBehaviour`](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/MonoBehaviour.html "MonoBehaviour") (or the extended version provided with Kaiju Agents, [`KaijuBehaviour`](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuBehaviour.html "KaijuBehaviour") instead) and listening for callbacks, accessing properties, and calling methods from the [`KaijuAgent` API](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuAgent.html "KaijuAgent"). As this workflow is so common, the [controller classes](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/controllers.html) provide starting points to do this.

## Identifiers

For easy comparing of agent types, you can set identifiers for agents, allowing for easy querying with the [manager](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/manager.html) as well as with the included [agents vision sensor](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/sensors.html#agents-vision-sensor "Agents Vision Sensor").

## Spawning and Despawning

You can either have agents already in the scene when starting the scene which can be created following the instructions in the [getting started documentation](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/getting-started.html#next-steps "Getting Started - Next Steps") or at runtime via the [`KaijuAgents.Spawn(KaijuAgentType, Nullable<Vector3>, Nullable<Quaternion>, Boolean, KaijuAgent, String, Nullable<Color>, Nullable<Color>, ICollection<Type>)` method](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuAgents.html#KaijuSolutions_Agents_KaijuAgents_Spawn_KaijuSolutions_Agents_KaijuAgentType_System_Nullable_Vector3__System_Nullable_Quaternion__System_Boolean_KaijuSolutions_Agents_KaijuAgent_System_String_System_Nullable_Color__System_Nullable_Color__System_Collections_Generic_ICollection_System_Type__ "KaijuAgents.Spawn(KaijuAgentType, Nullable<Vector3>, Nullable<Quaternion>, Boolean, KaijuAgent, String, Nullable<Color>, Nullable<Color>, ICollection<Type>)").

For despawning, you can destroy the agents just like any other [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html "GameObject") or [component](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html "Component"), but the better option is to use the [`Despawn()` method](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuAgent.html#KaijuSolutions_Agents_KaijuAgent_Despawn "KaijuAgent - Despawn"). This will keep the agent in memory and allow it to be reused by a future [`KaijuAgents.Spawn(KaijuAgentType, Nullable<Vector3>, Nullable<Quaternion>, Boolean, KaijuAgent, String, Nullable<Color>, Nullable<Color>, ICollection<Type>)`](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuAgents.html#KaijuSolutions_Agents_KaijuAgents_Spawn_KaijuSolutions_Agents_KaijuAgentType_System_Nullable_Vector3__System_Nullable_Quaternion__System_Boolean_KaijuSolutions_Agents_KaijuAgent_System_String_System_Nullable_Color__System_Nullable_Color__System_Collections_Generic_ICollection_System_Type__ "KaijuAgents.Spawn(KaijuAgentType, Nullable<Vector3>, Nullable<Quaternion>, Boolean, KaijuAgent, String, Nullable<Color>, Nullable<Color>, ICollection<Type>)") call, thus keeping garbage collection to a minimum.
