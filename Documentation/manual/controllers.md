# Controllers

Controllers allow for easily access [agent](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/agents.html "Agents") callbacks without having to worry about binding to [C# events](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/events "C# Events"). Two versions are provided of which you can extend from:

1. [`KaijuController`](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuController.html "KaijuController") - This attaches directly to an [agent](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/agents.html "Agents") on the same [GameObject](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-GameObject.html "GameObject") and listens to callbacks specifically for the associated [agent](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/agents.html "Agents").
2. [`KaijuGlobalController`](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuGlobalController.html "KaijuGlobalController") - This controller receives all global callbacks for all [agents](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/agents.html "Agents") in the scene. Unlike the [`KaijuController`](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuController.html "KaijuController"), this does not need to be attached to an [agent](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/manual/agents.html "Agents"). In most use cases, a [`KaijuController`](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuController.html "KaijuController") will be more effective to use than a [`KaijuGlobalController`](https://agents.kaijusolutions.ca/api/KaijuSolutions.Agents.KaijuGlobalController.html "KaijuGlobalController").
